# Copy Keeper

This is an experimental extension for Firefox that saves everything you copy to the clipboard.

The data is saved locally, and can be viewed in a sidebar.

In addition to the text you copy, the source page, and a screenshot is captured.

Old clips are searchable.

## Install

To install and test out:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ianb/copy-keeper.git
$ cd copy-keeper
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
